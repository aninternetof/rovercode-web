rovercode is an open-source educational robotics platform. Students use our web-based drag-and-drop editor to create
code that listens to the rover's sensors and controls its motors.

rovercode is made up of serveral code repositories. You are currently viewing rovercode-web, the web application 
that provides the drag-and-drop coding interface and user management. To learn about the other pieces of rovercode,
visit our `architecture documentation <https://contributor-docs.rovercode.com/architecture.html>`_, or start at `the
root of rovercode's documentation <https://contributor-docs.rovercode.com>`_.
